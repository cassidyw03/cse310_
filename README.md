# Overview

{I am trying to become a more versatile software developer with my next few projects and this is where I am starting.}

{This project shows a simple "Hello World" program that makes the text flash for a time period and then stop. I wanted to make it fun.}

{The reason I made this was to have a foundation for myself as I begin working on different projects and expanding my knowledge.}

# Development Environment

{A tool I used to make this software was Claude.AI. It reminded me the proper syntax for functions and while loops in Python.}

{This code was written in Python.}
