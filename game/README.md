# Overview

{This project was to increase my understanding of game frameworks and try to create a product that was fun.}

{The goal of this game is to get the highest amount of points you can. The player gets points by collecting flowers that fall from the top. The player moves side to side with the arrow keys. The challenge is bees will also be falling from the top and the player must avoid them or the game is over!}

{The purpose of writing this software was to learn more about using Arcade and create a nice looking game.}

# Development Environment

{Arcade was a useful tool to create this game! It has everything needed to create the game and many helpful function that are defined.}

{This was made in python. Libraries used were Arcade and the random library. Arcade helped with the framework of the game and especially displays while random helped me bring chance into my game for how often the enemies (bees) and the good sprites (flowers) fell from the top.}

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* Item 1: In the future I need to fix the background music loop problem. When the player chooses to play again the game runs again without stopping the music so it overlaps. To fix this I need to stop the music when the quit screen appears or not start the music again the second + times that the game is replayed.
* Item 2: I want to make this game more difficult as the player goes. So more bees would fall or everything would gradually fall faster.
* Item 3: I also thought of adding special items that are higher point amounts that only come rarely. I have different items falling at different frequencies already I just need to change the format of the game so that different sprites can have different point values.
