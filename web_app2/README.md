# Overview

{This project helped me further my project as a software engineer by helping me understand a little Django and node.js in web app development.}

{Provide a description the web app that you wrote. Describe how to start a test server on your computer and what website to open up to see the first page of the app.
This web app is a portfolio for my projects. As I go along I hope to add my future projects as well. It has an interactive contact form where visitors can submit a message! The website includes about me information and skills. The app is build using Express for the server-side logic and EJS for the rendering of the HTML pages. To start a test-server run node app.js or npm run dev. After starting go to the local host id. This will take you to the home page.}

{My purpose to write this software was to learn how to use node.js more and also explore Django. It also was to have a great medium to display a portfolio of my projects for recruiters.}

# Web Pages

{There are two pages. A homepage containing a welcome and an about me section. Visitors can go to the next page through the Projects link. The Contact us is also at the bottom of this page. The title is dynamically inserted using EJS. The Projects page shows some of my projects with descriptions. Each is rendered using EJS. The page transition works through "back to home" with Express. The contact us section lets visitors submit a message to me.}

# Development Environment

{The tools used were node.js and Express to hold the server. EJS renders the pages!}

{This is written in HTML, CSS, and javascript.}

# Useful Websites

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* Item 1- I want to add more projects and display them with a visual (if applicable,) or descriptions.
* Item 2- I would want to add a database to hold the messages that people send to me via the "Contact me." Then I could actually receive the messages. I would also have to host this page on another server.
* Item 3- I would want to make it slightly more visually appealing. I think I could make it more my own but still professional ith a few tweaks. It would also be cool to add a built in game that people could fin on the site as well!
